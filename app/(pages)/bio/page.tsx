          I was born on February 10, 2002 in the small town of Khanabad and
          studied there until the 9th grade. As a child, I was a “nerd” in
          computer games, and at the moment we also play Counter-Strike with
          friends. My life changed when I entered the academic lyceum, but when
          I left home, my goal was not to study, but simply to continue playing
          video games.

          Everything changed when school began. I thought that it would be the
          same story as at school, but it turned out to be the opposite: all the
          guys studied very well, and the teachers were at a different level
          compared to the school teachers. After finishing my first year, my
          results were very bad, and they even tried to expel me from the
          lyceum.

          In my second year I decided to change everything. I worked hard on
          myself and was able to change my situation. However, when the decisive
          stage of my studies came - the exams at the university, I failed them,
          just a little bit.

          After that, I wanted to quit studying and thought about going to work
          somewhere to help my parents. But my mother said that I would have
          time to work, and that I should study, be strong. And after that I
          continued my studies, entering the university, not on a contract, but
          on a budget at TUIT University.
